    "\n",
    "This file **bridges your fine-tuned BioGPT model with the agent system**. It's crucial because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulates Model Complexity** - Agents don't need to know how to load/run the model\n",
    "2. **Provides Consistent Interface** - All agents call the same `generate()` method\n",
